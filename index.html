  <!-- CONDITION 1 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>📚 If you the “reading warrior” type:</h2>
    <p>
      Roll over to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/">W3Schools</a>.  
      Free or paid, whatever fits your pockets and your soul.

    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONDITION 2 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>🎥 If video-learning speaks to your spirit:</h2>
    <p>
      Hit up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh">Mosh Hamedani</a>.  
      Bro teaches Python like he narratin’ a National Geographic documentary about your brain evolving.  
      Free, paid, premium, ultra, chakra-aligned — pick your blessing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONDITION 3 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>🛠️ If you a DIY, self-made, midnight-coding person:</h2>
    <p>
      Summon <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a>,  
      or <a href="https://grok.com">Grok</a>,  
      or <a href="https://kimi.moonshot.cn/">Kimi</a>.  
      Ask anything. Build anything. Complain about bugs at 3 a.m. if you need to.  
      This is project-based spirituality.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONDITION 4 -->
  <div class="section">

      Then you need <a href="https://coursera.org">Coursera</a>.  
      Courses with mentors, graded work, university vibes, and peaceful learning energy.  
      “Young grasshopper, today you will conquer for loops.”
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- CONDITION 5 -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>🎖️ If you need certificates that actually matter:</h2>
    <p>

      Show the world you Python-literate now.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- TIPS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>🧠💬 Extra Tips (not for everybody)</h2>

    <h3>1. Follow your energy, not military schedules</h3>
    <p>
      Life ain’t bootcamp. If your soul say “I wanna learn lists today,” go do it.  
      If your soul say “I need noodles before I write a function,” obey it.  
      Flow like water, code like Bruce Lee.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Make learning feel like a playground, not a prison</h3>
    <p>
      When you enjoy it, your brain turns into a turbocharged engine.  
      When you hate it, your brain loads slower than Windows XP in 2004.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Don’t bully yourself with pressure</h3>
    <p>
      Curiosity is a gift, not punishment.  
      If you get tired, pause. Touch grass. Drink tea.  
      Tell yourself: “Zohair, you a cosmic being on a coding quest.”  
      Then dive back in when you’re ready.
    </p>

  <!-- Philosophy -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>🔥 Mini Philosophy Boost</h2>
    <p>
      Coding is like life: sometimes it works, sometimes it throws errors.  
      Sometimes it’s your fault, sometimes the universe acting dramatic.  
      Every line you write is a rebellion against ignorance.  
      Every bug you fix is a negotiation with chaos.  
      Python isn’t the goal — growth is.  
      Python just the vehicle you drivin’ with the windows down, music loud, confidence high 🚗🎶🐍✨
